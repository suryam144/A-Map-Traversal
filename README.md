• Implemented A* and Theta* Algorithms, along with heuristics, in Python to find the most optimal traversal of
randomized grid-based paths with constraints in map

• Developed back-end code in team setting to optimize algorithms for maximum efficiency and analyzed comparisons
of algorithm effectiveness
